# Custom Video Player

The bulk of this custom video player is from Wes Bos' JavaScript30 course. He somewhat famously challenges you to add fullscreen capability to the project, which I did when I first took the course awhile back.

However, he does not do the tutorial with tooltips for scrubbing or with a 'currentTime/duration' view in the UI. So I took that on with setInterval and a pretty handy timeString one-liner. Feel free to have a look!

If anyone has any notes on smoothing out the animation on that progress bar I'd appreciate it!
